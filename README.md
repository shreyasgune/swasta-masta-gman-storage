# swasta-masta-gman-storage
स्वस्त आणि मस्त  GMAN Storage. Cuz things are hella expensive and yaboi don't wanna pay a ton for my storage solutions.

# GCP time 
We are going to use GCP Storage as our desired solution. Because paishey naahi aahet.

## Kevdha Swasta?

Coldline Storage is a highly durable, low-cost service for storing data which is infrequently accessed. Coldline Storage is a superior option than Nearline Storage or Standard Storage in situations where a 90-day minimum storage time, a tiny bit less availability, and higher costs related to data access are admissible trade-offs for less at-rest storage charges.

Nearline Storage costs:

- $0.007 per GB-month for storage

- $0.02/GB for data retrieval

## Bringing stuff into existence
`terraform init`
<details> 

```
terraform init -var-file=swasta_masta.tfvars

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/google...
- Installing hashicorp/google v5.3.0...
- Installed hashicorp/google v5.3.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

## Arey but bucket create hua kya?
Lets C

`gcloud storage buckets list --project your-project-id`

``` 
creation_time: DA_TIMESTAMP
default_storage_class: COLDLINE
location: US
location_type: multi-region
metageneration: 2
name: gman-bucket
public_access_prevention: inherited
rpo: DEFAULT
storage_url: gs://gman-bucket/
uniform_bucket_level_access: true
```

## Achcha okay, so how do I take my local stuff and throw it in there?

- lets say you have a folder mystuff (it will be included in this repo)

- Add a text file in that folder, hello_there.txt

- GSUTIL lagega: `gcloud components install gsutil`
- Authenticate your service account: `gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=<YOUR_SA_JSON>`
- Sync Command :  `gsutil -m rsync -r <YOUR_FOLDER> gs://gman-bucket/`
- Lets C
```
gsutil -m rsync \\wsl$\Ubuntu/home/sgune/devs/swasta-masta-gman-storage/mystuff gs://gman-bucket/mystuff
Building synchronization state...
